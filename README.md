October 6, 2023 \
Coding questions for Pizza &amp; Code event at Howard University \

**Question 1:** Create a Python program that calculates the total price of a pizza order based on user input. The user should be able to specify the size of the pizza (small, medium, or large) and the number of toppings. Each topping costs a fixed amount. Display the total price to the user. \

**Question 2:** Create a Python program that helps plan a pizza party. The user should enter the number of guests, and the program should calculate the number of pizzas needed based on the average number of slices each guest eats and the size of the pizzas available (small, medium, or large). Display the number of pizzas required. \

**Question 3:** Write a Python program that takes a pizza order as input (e.g., "large pepperoni and mushroom pizza") and extracts information about the pizza's size and toppings. Display this information to the user.
